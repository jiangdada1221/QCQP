# QCQP
Course project of ECE-273 Convex optimization. An overview of quadratically constrained quadratic program.

In the project, I did a summary of relaxations for non-convex QCQP problems and found some conditions under which those relaxations are tight.
Besides, I investigated conditions to show that the QCQP problems have hidden convexity. At last, I compared the performance between semidifinite relaxation and a non-convex algorithm applied to solve a simple multicast beamforming problem. <br />
